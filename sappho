Deathless Aphrodite of the spangled mind,
child of Zeus, who twists lures, I beg you
do not break with hard pains,
	O lady, my heart

but come here if ever before
you caught my voice far off
and listening left your father's
	golden house and came,

yoking your car. And fine birds brought you,
quick sparrows over the black earth
whipping their wings down the sky
	through midair—

they arrived. But you, O blessed one,
smiled in your deathless face
and asked what (now again) I have suffered and why
	(now again) I am calling out

and what I want to happen most of all
in my crazy heart. Whom should I persuade (now again)
to lead you back into her love? Who, O
	Sappho, is wronging you?

For if she flees, soon she will pursue.
If she refuses gifts, rather will she give them.
If she does not love, soon she will love
	even unwilling.

Come to me now: loose me from hard
care and all my heart longs
to accomplish, accomplish. You
	be my ally.

here to me from Krete to this holy temple
where is your graceful grove
of apple trees and altars smoking
	with frankincense.

And in it cold water makes a clear sound through
apple branches and with roses the whole place
is shadowed and down from radiant-shaking leaves
	sleep comes dropping.

And in it a horse meadow has come into bloom
